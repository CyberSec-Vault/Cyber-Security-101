# OSI Model Overview & TCP/IP Model Overview &  Understanding IP Addresses & UDP vs TCP – Transport Layer Protocols & Encapsulation and the Life of a Packet

Understanding the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model can initially feel overwhelming, but it's a powerful conceptual framework that helps break down how network communications work. Developed by ISO, it defines how different networking components interact in a structured way.

The OSI model is composed of **seven layers**, from **Layer 1 (Physical)** at the bottom to **Layer 7 (Application)** at the top. A common mnemonic to remember them is:

# 🌐 TCP/IP Model Overview

Now that we understand the conceptual **OSI model**, it's time to look at a more **practical implementation**—the **TCP/IP model**.

TCP/IP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol**, and it was developed by the **U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)** in the 1970s. One of its main strengths lies in its resilience: the network can **adapt and continue to operate** even when parts of it are down, thanks to **robust routing protocols** designed to adjust to network changes—a vital feature for military and critical infrastructure.

---

## 📚 TCP/IP vs OSI: Top-Down Approach

Unlike the OSI model (which goes from physical layer upward), we’ll now examine the **TCP/IP model from top to bottom**:

### 1. **Application Layer**
- **OSI Equivalent**: Combines **Layers 5, 6, and 7** (Session, Presentation, Application)
- **Function**: Provides services and protocols used by applications to communicate over the network.
- **Examples**: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, Telnet, SSH

### 2. **Transport Layer**
- **OSI Equivalent**: Layer 4
- **Function**: Ensures reliable or best-effort data delivery between hosts.
- **Examples**: TCP, UDP

### 3. **Internet Layer**
- **OSI Equivalent**: Layer 3 (Network Layer)
- **Function**: Handles logical addressing and routing across networks.
- **Examples**: IP, ICMP, IPSec

### 4. **Link Layer**
- **OSI Equivalent**: Layer 2 (Data Link) and **sometimes Layer 1 (Physical)**
- **Function**: Defines how data is physically sent over the medium, including protocols for local communication.
- **Examples**: Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11)

## 📦 5-Layer TCP/IP Model (Used in Some Books)

Some modern textbooks (e.g., *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach*) describe the **TCP/IP model with five layers**, adding the **Physical Layer** explicitly:

1. Application  
2. Transport  
3. Network  
4. Link  
5. Physical  

This is especially helpful in educational contexts to clarify the role of the **physical transmission medium**.

---

## 🔜 What’s Next?

In the following sections, we will:

- Dive into **IP protocols** (used in the Internet layer)
- Study **TCP and UDP** (used in the Transport layer)

These core components make up the backbone of modern internet communication. Stay tuned!





# 🧭 Understanding IP Addresses

When you hear the term **IP address**, you might think of values like `192.168.0.1` or `172.16.159.243`. These are **IPv4** addresses — the most widely used form of IP addressing.

---

## 🏠 IP Address as a Unique Identifier

Just like your **home postal address** helps you receive mail, an **IP address** uniquely identifies a device on a network. Without it, data can’t find its way to the right recipient.

Using the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, every device (host) must have a **unique IP address** to communicate unambiguously.

---

## 📏 IP Address Format: IPv4

An **IPv4 address**:
- Consists of **4 octets** (4 × 8 = 32 bits total).
- Each octet ranges from **0 to 255**.
- Example: `192.168.1.1`

> ⚠️ The first and last addresses in a subnet are **reserved**:
> - `192.168.1.0` → **Network Address**
> - `192.168.1.255` → **Broadcast Address**

🧮 The total number of IPv4 addresses is approximately **2³² = 4.3 billion**. Some are reserved, so the actual usable number is slightly less.

---

## 🔍 Checking IP Configuration

### On Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```










# 📡 UDP vs TCP – Transport Layer Protocols

The **IP protocol** helps us reach a **host** using its IP address, but we need another layer to help **processes** on different hosts communicate. This is where **transport layer protocols** come into play.

Two main protocols operate at **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**:
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

---

## 📬 UDP – User Datagram Protocol

**UDP** is a **simple, fast, and connectionless** transport protocol.

### ✅ Key Features:
- **No connection setup** required.
- **No delivery guarantee** (no acknowledgements or retries).
- Operates using **port numbers** to target specific processes.
- **Faster** than TCP but **less reliable**.

### 📦 Real-World Analogy:
> Sending a letter through **standard mail** with **no delivery confirmation**.
> It’s faster and cheaper, but you don’t know if it arrived.

### 🔢 Port Numbers:
- Used to identify sending and receiving processes.
- Range: **1 to 65535** (port **0** is **reserved**).
- Port number = 16 bits (2 octets) → `2^16 - 1 = 65535`

### 🧪 Example Use Cases:
- DNS
- Video streaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- Online multiplayer games

---

## 📦 TCP – Transmission Control Protocol

**TCP** is a **connection-oriented** protocol designed for **reliable communication**.

### ✅ Key Features:
- **Connection setup required** before data transfer.
- **Reliability mechanisms**: sequencing, acknowledgements, retransmissions.
- **Ensures ordered and complete delivery** of data.
- Uses **port numbers** like UDP.

### 📦 Real-World Analogy:
> Sending a package via **registered mail** with **delivery tracking** and **confirmation**.

---

## 🤝 The TCP Three-Way Handshake

Before communication begins, **TCP establishes a connection** using a **three-step process**:

1. **SYN** – Client sends a SYN packet with an initial sequence number.
2. **SYN-ACK** – Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, containing its own sequence number.
3. **ACK** – Client sends back an ACK to confirm the connection.

```text
Client          Server
   | --- SYN ---> |
   | <--- SYN-ACK |
   | --- ACK ---> |
Connection Established ✅
```




# 📦 Encapsulation and the Life of a Packet

Before we conclude, it’s crucial to understand **encapsulation**—a core concept in networking.

---

## 📌 What Is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** refers to the process of **each layer adding its own header (and sometimes a trailer)** to the data unit received from the layer above, forming a complete protocol data unit (PDU) for transmission to the lower layer.

This modular approach allows each layer to **focus on its own responsibilities** and enables efficient communication across complex networks.

---

### 🔁 Step-by-Step: Encapsulation Process

| Layer             | Action                                                                              | Resulting Unit           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Application**   | Formats user input (e.g., sending a message)                                        | Application Data         |
| **Transport**     | Adds a **TCP header** or **UDP header**                                             | TCP Segment / UDP Datagram |
| **Network**       | Adds an **IP header**                                                               | IP Packet                |
| **Data Link**     | Adds a **link-layer header** and **trailer** (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi)              | Frame                    |

> 🔁 This entire process is **reversed** on the **receiving device**, with each layer removing and interpreting its respective headers.

---

## 🌍 The Life of a Packet – Simplified Journey

Let’s walk through an example of sending a search query on TryHackMe:

1. **User Input**: You type a search query and press Enter.
2. **Application Layer**: The browser formats this as an **HTTP request** using the HTTPS protocol.
3. **Transport Layer (TCP)**:
   - Initiates a **TCP connection** using a **3-way handshake**.
   - Once established, wraps the HTTP request in a **TCP segment**.
4. **Network Layer (IP)**:
   - Adds **source IP** (your device) and **destination IP** (TryHackMe server).
   - Passes down an **IP packet**.
5. **Link Layer (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)**:
   - Adds a **link-layer header and trailer**, creating a **frame**.
   - Sends the frame to the **next-hop router**.
6. **Routers**:
   - Strip the link-layer frame, inspect the **IP header**.
   - Forward the packet toward its **destination**, repeating the process.
7. **Destination Network**:
   - The reverse process begins as the **frame** reaches the destination.
   - Each layer **decapsulates** its part, eventually delivering the original HTTP request to the TryHackMe server application.
