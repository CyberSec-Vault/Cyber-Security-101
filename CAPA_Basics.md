# üõ°Ô∏è CAPA Basics in Cybersecurity

**CAPA** stands for **Corrective and Preventive Action**. It is a crucial process in cybersecurity, compliance, and risk management to identify, fix, and prevent security incidents or vulnerabilities from recurring.

## üìå What is CAPA?

CAPA is a two-part strategy:

| Type       | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Corrective Action** | Addresses and fixes the root cause of a detected issue (reactive).        |
| **Preventive Action** | Identifies potential risks and takes action to prevent future occurrences (proactive). |

## üß† Why is CAPA Important in Cybersecurity?

In cybersecurity, CAPA is essential for:

- Reducing **recurring incidents** (e.g., repeated phishing attacks, misconfigurations)
- Ensuring **compliance** with standards like ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA, etc.
- Strengthening **incident response** and **security posture**
- Creating a culture of **continuous improvement**

## üîÑ CAPA Lifecycle in Cybersecurity

1. **Detection**
   - Incident is identified (e.g., unauthorized access, malware infection)

2. **Investigation**
   - Root cause analysis (RCA)
   - Impact assessment

3. **Corrective Action**
   - Immediate fix to eliminate the root cause
   - Patch vulnerabilities, revoke access, isolate infected systems

4. **Preventive Action**
   - Update policies and procedures
   - Conduct staff training
   - Apply additional controls (e.g., MFA, IDS)

5. **Verification**
   - Confirm that the corrective and preventive actions are effective

6. **Documentation**
   - Maintain records of actions taken for audits and future reference

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: CAPA in Action

### Scenario:
An employee falls victim to a phishing email and provides login credentials.

### ‚úÖ Corrective Action:
- Force password reset
- Revoke sessions
- Scan the device for malware

### ‚úÖ Preventive Action:
- Conduct phishing awareness training
- Implement email filtering
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Root Cause: Lack of phishing awareness and MFA

Corrective Action:
- Reset user credentials
- Investigated all associated systems

Preventive Action:
- Phishing awareness training conducted
- MFA implemented across all user accounts

Verification Date: 2025-08-07
